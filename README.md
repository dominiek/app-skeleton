_This app skeleton works with [Node.js API Skeleton](https://github.com/dominiek/node-api-skeleton)_

# Simple JS App Skeleton

Here's an app skeleton that binds together common frameworks du-jour:

* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
* [React Semantic UI](http://react.semantic-ui.com/)
* [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
* [ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [React Router V4](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)
* [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/)
* [Final Form](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)

_Note: The purpose of this skeleton is to provide a simple UI skeleton that can be supplemented with backend/deployment specific tools (Node, Ethereum, Mobile, etc)._

## Other Features

* Seemless pushState routing using React Router V4
* Full login/signup flow with separate dashboard and homepage router
* All CSS and assets served via Webpack/StyleLoader
* Uses Semantic UI as a rich UI element base
* Uses ES6 style React components
* Code hotswapping
* Static server

## Install Dependencies

Run in the project root folder:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

The following command serves all HTML/JS/CSS and watches all changes to `src/*.js`

```bash
npm start
```

UI is running at [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/)
Admin is running at [http://localhost:3002/](http://localhost:3002/)

## Directory Structure

* `package.json` - Configure dependencies
* `webpack.config.js` - Bundling and build configuration
* `serve-static` - Static server
* `serve` - Static server for development
* `dist/*` - Files generated by webpack, incuding index.html. These are the assets that should be HTTP served
* `src/utils` - Home of specific JS helper utilities like for example `request.js` for doing API requests
* `src/components` - Home of reuseable components
* `src/assets` - Images, favicons, pdf ...
* `src/config` - Configurations
* `src/App/*` - Components that are tightly coupled to the App UI
* `src/App/index` - Main entrypoint into App UI
* `src/Admin/*` - Components that are tightly coupled to the Admin UI
* `src/Admin/index` - Main entrypoint into Admin UI

## TODO

* [ ] Bundle improvements
* [ ] Add Dashboard section
* [ ] Add settings section
* [ ] Admin UI
